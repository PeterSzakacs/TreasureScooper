Currently all images are made using widths and heights equal to powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, ...)

For simplicity of creation and (possibly) handling within the code, the background image is created 
using a fixed resolution of 4096 x 2048 px, and was drawn with the help of a fixed grid with square cells 
(to show it, simply open it in GIMP, or open the generated images in any editor that can display a grid 
over the image and set the length and width of the smallest unit in the grid).

Currently the smallest grid square for the background (and the size of all other images) is 128 x 128 px. 
There is a version of the background made with 64 x 64 px grid squares, but the images have no 64 x 64 px 
variant (You have to open the image file and scale it down to that size, if you really want to try it).
